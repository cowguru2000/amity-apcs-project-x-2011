/**
 * A standard template for classes.
 * 
 * The API of this class should remain constant; more methods and fields may be
 * added, but never changed or removed.
 * 
 * The internal implementation of this class may be significantly more
 * ephemeral, and is subject to unforseeable change.
 * 
 * Thus, as a rule of thumb: everything should be private unless it is
 * documented, so as to protect yourself from relying on things that might be
 * refactored.
 * 
 * If you need something private, write appropriate documentation BEFORE the
 * code itself, so that you set well-defined limits for what you're doing.
